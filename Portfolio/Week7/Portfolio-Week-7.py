# 1.Write and test a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns a sorted list of all the unique letters used in the string. So, if the string is cheese, the list returned should be ['c', 'e', 'h', 's'].

def sorted_letters(input_string):
    input_string = input_string.lower()
    unique_letters = sorted(set(char for char in input_string if char.isalpha()))

    return unique_letters

# Testing the function 
result =sorted_letters("cheese")
print(result)
print()


#2. Write and test three functions that each take two words (strings) as parameters and return sorted lists (as defined above) representing respectively:
    #Letters that appear in at least one of the two words.
    #Letters that appear in both words.
    #Letters that appear in either word, but not in both.

def letters_in_either(word1, word2):
    common = set(word1) & set(word2)
    return sorted(list(common))

def letters_either_not_both(word1, word2):
    unique = set(word1) ^ set(word2)
    return sorted(list(unique))

def letters_in_both(word1, word2):
    shared = set(word1) & set(word2)
    unique_word1 = set(word1) - shared
    unique_word2 = set(word2) - shared
    return sorted(list(shared)), sorted(list(unique_word1)), sorted(list(unique_word2))

# Testing the functions with words "hello" and "world"
result_either = letters_in_either("hello","world")
result_both = letters_in_both("hello","world")
result_either_not_both = letters_either_not_both("hello","world")

print("Letters in either word:", result_either)
print("Letters in both words:", result_both)
print("Letters in either, but not both:", result_either_not_both)
print()



#3. Write a program that manages a list of countries and their capital cities. It should prompt the user to enter the name of a country. If the program already "knows" the name of the capital city, it should display it. Otherwise it should ask the user to enter it. This should carry on until the user terminates the program (how this happens is up to you).

country_capitals = {}

while True:
    
    country_name = input("Enter the name of a country (or type 'exit' to end): ")
    if country_name.lower() == 'exit':
        break

    
    if country_name in country_capitals:
        print(f"The capital of {country_name} is {country_capitals[country_name]}.")
    else:
        capital_city = input(f"The capital of {country_name} is not known. Enter the capital city: ")
        country_capitals[country_name] = capital_city
        print(f"Thank you! The capital of {country_name} ({capital_city}) has been added to the database.")


print("\nCountries and their capitals:")

for country, capital in country_capitals.items():
    print(f"{country}: {capital}")
    print()



#4. Write a program that processes a string representing a message and reports the six most common letters, along with the number of times they appear. Case should not matter, so "E" and "e" are considered the same.
    
from collections import Counter

def frequency_analysis(message):
    message = message.lower()

    char_counts = Counter(char for char in message if char.isalpha())
    most_common = char_counts.most_common(6)
    print("Six most common letters and their counts:")
    for char, count in most_common:
        print(f"{char}: {count}")

# Example usage:
encrypted_message = "Hello WORLDE.Thns bdyubhjd eb wsHBAHj f"
frequency_analysis(encrypted_message)
